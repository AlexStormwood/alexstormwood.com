Continuing on from [week two](/articles/202511-japan-004/), now I head up to one of my favourite areas of Japan: Sapporo!

I'm a big fan of cold weather, and snows reach Sapporo before they reach mainland Japan. Oh, yeah - Sapporo is in Hokkaido, a separate island from the rest of Japan. It's like a whole different region!

## Arrival 

Snow!


## Wardrobe VS Early-Winter Weather

I'll be honest, I was hoping for snow but my only memory of the heavily-snowed Sapporo from my last trip (middle of winter: January 2024) had me going "gee, it was so hot indoors, the snow had zero impact on me since I spent so little time outside". And that led to me packing for _this_ trip in a way where I left my snow-ready jacket and gloves back in Sydney. 

So imagine my surprise when I rock up to Sapporo, step off the airport-to-city bus, and immediately get soaked from freshly-falling snow. 

This wasn't in the memories - it never actually actively snowed on my previous trip! The snow was already on the ground, piled up and out of the way so we could walk easily. What's all this?!

It took me 10 minutes to walk from the bus stop to my hotel, and in that time I realised a few things about my wardrobe:

- the trusty ol' Unity (game engine) zip-up hoodie I wear in cold weather (read: rarely) is not good for snow
- that same hoodie's hood is also useless, does not cover my face 
- my long jeans that I wear in extra-cold weather (read: never) no longer fit, squeezing my shins like crazy
- the gloves that I left behind because I didn't need them on the previous trip are actually super important when it's snowing, because your fingers do freeze first (at least, mine do)

In my luggage, I did pack snow-ready jeans. Big thick jeans with padded (down, I think?) filling in the legs. I tried those on before I left and they fit, but I remember being insanely hot when wearing them. Jeans don't have layers to pull off when going indoors, so I didn't feel keen on wearing those snow jeans at all. 


## Nerd Merch 

So much shopping!


## White Illumination

It's like Vivid Sydney, but more-sensible and Christmas-coded and enhanced by snow. 

## Exploring Sapporo 

Shrines, shrines, shrines, and a zoo! 

## Oddities

Quirks of Sapporo.


## The Next Part

And with that, my trip in Tokyo finishes up - in the next part, I fly up to Sapporo to spend 15 days up there! Bring on the cold and snow!
