Continuing on from [week two](/articles/202511-japan-004/), now I head up to one of my favourite areas of Japan: Sapporo!

I'm a big fan of cold weather, and snows reach Sapporo before they reach mainland Japan. Oh, yeah - Sapporo is in Hokkaido, a separate island from the rest of Japan. It's like a whole different region!

## Arrival 

Flying from Tokyo to Sapporo is pretty uneventful - at least, for a bigger guy like me. Economy aisle seats for space, no window view. 

On the plus side: free movies on the seat screens and free wi-fi because it's a domestic flight! Good stuff. 

The airport at Sapporo - New Chitose Airport - is almost on the other side of Hokkaido. Compared to Haneda Airport in Tokyo (a quick 30 minute monorail trip to my hotel, awesome), it's a mild trek to get from the airport to the hotel. A train line is in the basement levels of the airport, and it's fine - you'd still have to catch more trains or walk further once arriving in Sapporo Station though, so I don't like taking that from the airport. 

There's also an airport bus that specifically goes directly to many of the major hotels in the city of Sapporo! So to minimise walking, take the bus! 

It's a good ride from the airport - and at night (specifically, 5pm), it's cool to see the different rural and suburban areas as we go past, and seeing how the snow affects these areas.

</div> 



After the airport bus, I still had to walk two blocks to reach my actual hotel. Real close to my destination, much closer than the airport train would've gotten me, but still...

Snow! Snow!! It's silly, but I really like seeing how weather impacts places like this - and snow, being such a rarity in Australia, is so cool to me. 

I get to the hotel, and make plans to go shopping for nicer snow-ready gear.

## Wardrobe VS Early-Winter Weather

I'll be honest, I was hoping for snow but my only memory of the heavily-snowed Sapporo from my last trip (middle of winter: January 2024) had me going "gee, it was so hot indoors, the snow had zero impact on me since I spent so little time outside, I didn't end up needing any snow-ready clothing at all". And that led to me packing for _this_ trip in a way where I left my snow-ready jacket and gloves back in Sydney. 

So imagine my surprise when I rock up to Sapporo, step off the airport-to-city bus, and immediately get soaked from freshly-falling snow. 

This wasn't in the memories - it never actually actively snowed on my previous trip! The snow was already on the ground, piled up and out of the way so we could walk easily. What's all this?!

It took me 10 minutes to walk from the bus stop to my hotel, and in that time I realised a few things about my wardrobe:

- the trusty ol' Unity (game engine) zip-up hoodie I wear in Australian cold weather (read: rarely) is not good for snow
- that same hoodie's hood is also useless, does not cover my face 
- my long jeans that I wear in Australian extra-cold weather (read: almost-never) no longer fit, squeezing my shins like crazy
- the gloves that I left behind because I didn't need them on the previous trip are actually super important when it's snowing, because your fingers do freeze first (at least, mine do)

In my luggage, I did pack snow-ready jeans. Big thick jeans with padded (down, I think?) filling in the legs. I tried those on before I left and they fit, but I remember being insanely hot when wearing them. Jeans don't have layers to pull off when going indoors, so I didn't feel keen on wearing those snow jeans at all. 

So, I looked around - Australian clothing stores rarely stock the sizes that I need, and Japanese clothing stores even-more-rarely stock the sizes that I need than Australian stores. But I found a "big and tall" clothing store in Sapporo! Three of them, with a "main branch" variant of the store as well: Big M1. 

That store was great, I got some "6L" jackets and some jeans that have better fitting around the legs and shins. Awesome stuff. The need for this stuff was heavily on my mind, even the entrance to the store looked like this: 

<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;">

	alt="A photo of the carpark of a clothing store. The carpark is covered in old snowfall." 
	/>
	
</div>


I got a basic plain black zip-up hoodie to replace my Unity zip-up hoodie, and it's great! Fits great, hood has a decent size, etc etc. 

And I got a nice big zip-up jacket with an even larger hood, different material, and a nice soft fluffy line to the hood. This one is guaranteed to keep snow out of my face:

<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;">

	alt="A photo of me wearing a big windbreaker jacket with a gigantic fluffy hoodie. The hood completely covers my face - perfect protection from falling snow." 
	/>
	
</div>



I took my time shopping for that clothing, all was great. It was a bit of a trek to the store though - way on the other/north side of Sapporo. By the time I was done out there, it was 4pm - almost night time in Sapporo at this time of year. Carrying big shopping bags of large clothing, I went back to the hotel and noticed something strange about all the snow I saw on the streets just a night ago...

<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;">

	alt="A photo of the streets of Sapporo, with buildings covered in LED signage lighting up the streets. The light from the signage reflects in the wet streets - rain-soaked, with no snow in sight." 
	/>
	
</div>


The snow melted away! Still, this new Japan-winter clothing came in handy during the time in Sapporo even without snow falling. The winds were freezing, the nights were chilling - I'm very glad I got this stuff! 

## Nerd Merch 

So much shopping to do! While I love the other areas of Japan that I've visited, Sapporo feels like a nice and simple place for all things nerdy. Everything is all real close - a second-hand nerd shop is right next to the first-hand nerd shop, which is next to another specialty nerd shop, which is next to a shopping street, next to some restaurants, and so on and so on. 

I mapped out my trip in Wanderlog (not sponsored), and my time in Sapporo really did concentrate around the southern part of the city. There's so many awesome shops for finding nerd merch in Sapporo, all close to each other! 

There was: 


#### The Pokemon Center

Mentioned in previous posts of this trip, I know. 

This store is right above Sapporo Station! I ended up going here a lot, because as it turns out: staying in Japan for a while - especially when the Christmas shopping season starts - means you'll see a _lot_ of new product launches. 

A plushie of a Pikachu wearing a beanie and scarf rolling a snowball launching alongside a line of new plushies that are "\{Pokemon} but if it were made as a snowman" was brilliant, had to get that (photos of that in the next blog post, since that snowman stuff was actually in the last week of the trip!). Also plenty of homewares like new drinking glasses, placemats, mugs, and so on!

	/>

	
</div>

The bath bombs are genius. Fish for Pokemon! And after a day of walking around chilling almost-snowing weather, you'll want a nice hot bath. There's a Pokemon thing for every part of life if you look hard enough!


#### "animate"

Mentioned in previous posts of this trip, I know. 

A great franchise chain of stores with one decently-sized store in Sapporo. This store sells first-hand latest-and-greatest manga, anime, fandom merch, art supplies, cosplay supplies, CDs, DVDs, etc etc - I  got a great copic marker tutorial book here to share with my very-artsy mum, as well as some soundtrack CDs for Pokemon and Splatoon games.

	/>
	
</div>



#### BOOKOFF

Mentioned in previous posts of this trip, I know. 

A phenomenal franchise chain of secondhand stores. This was not a "SUPER BAZAAR" variant of the store like I saw in Tokyo Bay, but it was still 4 floors of stock covering things like trading  cards, retro game cartridges, plushies, model kits, figurines, books, and so on. Absolutely fantastic place to find older merch. I got plushies and trading cards and model kits here, all really good stuff and in great condition as well! 


<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;">

	/>
	
</div>


#### Mandarake

Mentioned in previous posts of this trip, I know. 

Another franchise chain of secondhand stores. I _really_ like Mandarake stores for their stock variety and good prices (typically cheaper than BOOKOFF, at least for trading cards), but most Mandarake stores in Japan are designed like really cramped little knockoff shops. But the Mandarake in Sapporo is the best that I've been to: it has space to let you breathe and walk easily. 

And it's still a huge store as well! It covers the same types of products as both "animate" and Bookoff, but all secondhand. And the Sapporo Mandarake's cosplay section is _huge_. I bought some books and model kits and homewares here - it's a very good spot to find older Pokemon merch no longer stocked anywhere else!

	/>

</div>

#### Suruga-ya

I didn't end up buying anything from this one, but it was another second-hand store in the same building as Mandarake, and took up a chunk of the basement floor as well as another floor in the building. Good variety of goods if your arms and backpack aren't already full of shopping by the time you're done in Mandarake!

	/>

</div>

#### Don Quijote and MEGA Don Quijote

Sapporo has at least two Donki stores that I'm aware of, and they are both like if a grocery store was also a department store covering all types of products anyone might need in their entire life. The regular Donki was 2 floors of goods, the MEGA Donki was 5 or 6 floors and also included additional trading card stores in its upper levels. These are fantastic stores to visit even if you're not grabbing nerd merch - they are a fantastic place to get "I found this food in Japan, try it!"-type items to share with people back home as well. 

#### GEO

Great store for videogames, manga, TV shows, movies, electronics, and miscellaneous food and drink and so on. Kinda tucked away in one of the covered shopping streets in Sapporo, and I think they're a franchise chain as well, but this is another great spot to visit if you're questing for nerd stuff like I was. Just keep Google Translate handy - it's _all_ in Japanese in this store, no occasional English labels like in the other places I've listed. 



<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;">

	/>

</div>

I bought a lot of merch across numerous visits to all of those stores. It's been awesome.

## White Illumination

It's like Vivid Sydney, but more-sensible and Christmas-coded and enhanced by snow. 



<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;">

	/>

</div>

I rocked up to the opening night, and it was snowing _and_ packed! There was a great variety of German hand-made arts and crafts and decorations to buy, plenty of food and drinks (and an amazing chocolate smell from an almond booth), and a great chunk of Odori Park covered in wonderful light installations.

The German markets:

Sapporo Station had some nice decor up for the winter, though I'm not sure if it's strictly part of the White Illumination. I remember these  from my January 2024 trip, they may just be around the whole time? Either way, pretty stuff as well:

Really, snow would make Vivid Sydney so much more amazing. White Illumination was only a few city blocks long, not spread across the whole city, but felt way more interesting and condensed and just overall nicer than what I've seen from Vivid Sydney in recent years. Really glad I was in Sapporo for the right time to see this!

And all of this - I loved it, even with snow landing in my beard throughout the night - not enough snow to cover the ground, but enough to make for a funny selfie or two:

My night out at the White Illumination was real nice, and I ended up with a craving for a burger. So I found a "Bearfoot Bar" on the walk back to the hotel - and had to laugh. They were playing women's AFL on the bar TVs! Travelled all the way to the Japanese equivalent of Tasmania, I suppose the Australian stuff would pop up as well!

## Exploring Sapporo 

During this first week in Sapporo, I spent a few days just walking around the city. It's a great place to walk - very flat, until you go towards the obvious mountains like Mount Moiwa to the west of the city. I was planning to head out that way next week, but for now I focused on walking around the central and eastern parts of Sapporo.

I found a Shinto shrine for fortune and love:

		alt="A photo of a carved stone lion on a pedestal - a guardian of a temple." 
	/>

</div>

I found a Buddhist temple and indoor graveyard. It looked like a regular building from most sides of its exterior, but had nice little bits of detail like carvings in some corners, and a historic temple bell - the bell being the only original part of the temple remaining from over a century ago!

	/>

</div>

Visiting both a Shinto place and a Buddhist place one after the other kinda made me realise that I'm more interested in the Shinto stuff than the general Buddhist stuff. I'm much more interested in mythologies and religions that are more like "religion for respecting the land and country's sake". 

Shinto is much more like Australian Aboriginal "Dreaming" than like any other religion - tales based on the land, to live better amongst the land, and that interests me waaaaaaaaaaay more!

I mean, don't get me wrong: I liked both of the above places. I just like one type of place more than the other.

Later, I found a fish market or seafood street - though you can see the locals go off to the side of the main street to get their food!

And walking across the great spans across the rivers, with the Sapporo TV Tower in sight:

And finding one of the covered shopping streets near the hotel, in the southern part of Sapporo, with great restaurants under it and under its surrounding buildings:

The ability to just take my time and wander around was really nice. I know some people who have rushed around tourist spot to tourist spot in a whirlwind tour of Japan, and every story they tell of their trip is tained with complaints and whining - I wanted to make sure I had a good chunk of time away to soak up the _good_ of the places I visited, and I'm happy with what I've done in that regard! 

## Miscellaneous Oddities

During this week, I put up the lil magnetized door sign that says "yep, you can clean this room" on my hotel room door while I went out to the shops. I came back just after lunch and saw this on the hotel room TV: 



<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-wrap:wrap;">

	<img 
		width="100%" 
		src="\articles\202511-japan-005\06-oddities\20251122_130817.jpg" 
		alt="A photo of a TV screen displaying a grid relating hotel room numbers to a cleaning task status code." 
	/>

</div>


A cleaning management process! Task-tracking for a specific task! A system!

I love systems! I love figuring out how existing systems work, I love designing new or modified systems, I love it all. So this random lil TV screen got my brain buzzing.

- Different "A" status codes represent the room's need for cleaning, e.g. "room is empty, no need to clean", "room has someone in it and it's been days since the last clean, it should be cleaned today", 
- Different "B" status codes represent the room's cleaning task status, e.g. "cleaning pending", "in progress", "awaiting inspection"
- The whole thing is an app in the TV, a nice user interface with data managed on a centralised server. It has to be optimised for low-processing-power devices (locked-down smart TVs) and made for inputs from a specific type of controller (a TV remote, more in common with a gaming console controller than a mouse and keyboard!).

It was so tempting to just take a day to sit in the hotel room and code up my own version of this. I could do it. I have the skills! It'd be a cool portfolio piece! ...but that didn't feel like a good use of holiday time. 

Same goes for coding up my own elevator software - the logic involved in figuring out which floor to go to next, which elevator runs or not, etc etc - I could totally do that, and whole games are built around that sort of thing already! But I have other things to do with my time! 😅

Systems fascinate me, I love it!


## The Next Part

Week 1 of Sapporo is done, week 2 of Sapporo is up next! A bit less shopping, a lot more nature and walking around. 
Let's see if it'll actually snow again before I have to return to Australia...
