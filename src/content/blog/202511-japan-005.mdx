Continuing on from [week two](/articles/202511-japan-004/), now I head up to one of my favourite areas of Japan: Sapporo!

I'm a big fan of cold weather, and snows reach Sapporo before they reach mainland Japan. Oh, yeah - Sapporo is in Hokkaido, a separate island from the rest of Japan. It's like a whole different region!

## Arrival 

Flying from Tokyo to Sapporo is pretty uneventful - at least, for a bigger guy like me. Economy aisle seats for space, no window view. 

On the plus side: free movies on the seat screens and free wi-fi because it's a domestic flight! Good stuff. 

The airport at Sapporo - New Chitose Airport - is almost on the other side of Hokkaido. Compared to Haneda Airport in Tokyo (a quick 30 minute monorail trip to my hotel, awesome), it's a mild trek to get from the airport to the hotel. A train line is in the basement levels of the airport, and it's fine - you'd still have to catch more trains or walk further once arriving in Sapporo Station though, so I don't like taking that from the airport. 

There's also an airport bus that specifically goes directly to many of the major hotels in the city of Sapporo! So to minimise walking, take the bus! 

It's a good ride from the airport - and at night (specifically, 5pm), it's cool to see the different rural and suburban areas as we go past, and seeing how the snow affects these areas.

After the airport bus, I still had to walk two blocks to reach my actual hotel. Real close to my destination, much closer than the airport train would've gotten me, but still...

Snow! Snow!! It's silly, but I really like seeing how weather impacts places like this - and snow, being such a rarity in Australia, is so cool to me. 

I get to the hotel, and make plans to go shopping for nicer snow-ready gear.

## Wardrobe VS Early-Winter Weather

I'll be honest, I was hoping for snow but my only memory of the heavily-snowed Sapporo from my last trip (middle of winter: January 2024) had me going "gee, it was so hot indoors, the snow had zero impact on me since I spent so little time outside, I didn't end up needing any snow-ready clothing at all". And that led to me packing for _this_ trip in a way where I left my snow-ready jacket and gloves back in Sydney. 

So imagine my surprise when I rock up to Sapporo, step off the airport-to-city bus, and immediately get soaked from freshly-falling snow. 

This wasn't in the memories - it never actually actively snowed on my previous trip! The snow was already on the ground, piled up and out of the way so we could walk easily. What's all this?!

It took me 10 minutes to walk from the bus stop to my hotel, and in that time I realised a few things about my wardrobe:

- the trusty ol' Unity (game engine) zip-up hoodie I wear in Australian cold weather (read: rarely) is not good for snow
- that same hoodie's hood is also useless, does not cover my face 
- my long jeans that I wear in Australian extra-cold weather (read: almost-never) no longer fit, squeezing my shins like crazy
- the gloves that I left behind because I didn't need them on the previous trip are actually super important when it's snowing, because your fingers do freeze first (at least, mine do)

In my luggage, I did pack snow-ready jeans. Big thick jeans with padded (down, I think?) filling in the legs. I tried those on before I left and they fit, but I remember being insanely hot when wearing them. Jeans don't have layers to pull off when going indoors, so I didn't feel keen on wearing those snow jeans at all. 

So, I looked around - Australian clothing stores rarely stock the sizes that I need, and Japanese clothing stores even-more-rarely stock the sizes that I need than Australian stores. But I found a "big and tall" clothing store in Sapporo! Three of them, with a "main branch" variant of the store as well: Big M1. 

That store was great, I got some "6L" jackets and some jeans that have better fitting around the legs and shins. Awesome stuff. The need for this stuff was heavily on my mind, even the entrance to the store looked like this:

I got a basic plain black zip-up hoodie to replace my Unity zip-up hoodie, and it's great! Fits great, hood has a decent size, etc etc. 

And I got a nice big zip-up jacket with an even larger hood, different material, and a nice soft fluffy line to the hood. This one is guaranteed to keep snow out of my face:

I took my time shopping for that clothing, all was great. It was a bit of a trek to the store though - way on the other/north side of Sapporo. By the time I was done out there, it was 4pm - almost night time in Sapporo at this time of year. Carrying big shopping bags of large clothing, I went back to the hotel and noticed something strange about all the snow I saw on the streets just a night ago...

The snow melted away! Still, this new Japan-winter clothing came in handy during the time in Sapporo even without snow falling. The winds were freezing, the nights were chilling - I'm very glad I got this stuff! 

## Nerd Merch 

So much shopping to do! While I love the other areas of Japan that I've visited, Sapporo feels like a nice and simple place for all things nerdy. Everything is all real close - a second-hand nerd shop is right next to the first-hand nerd shop, which is next to another specialty nerd shop, which is next to a shopping street, next to some restaurants, and so on and so on. 

I mapped out my trip in Wanderlog (not sponsored), and my time in Sapporo really did concentrate around the southern part of the city. There's so many awesome shops for finding nerd merch in Sapporo, all close to each other! 

There was: 

### The Pokemon Center

Mentioned in previous posts of this trip, I know. 

This store is right above Sapporo Station! I ended up going here a lot, because as it turns out: staying in Japan for a while - especially when the Christmas shopping season starts - means you'll see a _lot_ of new product launches. 

A plushie of a Pikachu wearing a beanie and scarf rolling a snowball launching alongside a line of new plushies that are "\{Pokemon} but if it were made as a snowman" was brilliant, had to get that.

### "animate"

Mentioned in previous posts of this trip, I know. 

A great franchise chain of stores with one decently-sized store in Sapporo. This store sells first-hand latest-and-greatest manga, anime, fandom merch, art supplies, cosplay supplies, CDs, DVDs, etc etc - I  got a great copic marker tutorial book here to share with my very-artsy mum, as well as some soundtrack CDs for Pokemon and Splatoon games.

### BOOKOFF

Mentioned in previous posts of this trip, I know. 

A phenomenal franchise chain of secondhand stores. This was not a "SUPER BAZAAR" variant of the store like I saw in Tokyo Bay, but it was still 4 floors of stock covering things like trading  cards, retro game cartridges, plushies, model kits, figurines, books, and so on. Absolutely fantastic place to find older merch. I got plushies and trading cards and model kits here, all really good stuff and in great condition as well! 

### Mandarake

Mentioned in previous posts of this trip, I know. 

Another franchise chain of secondhand stores. I _really_ like Mandarake stores for their stock variety and good prices (typically cheaper than BOOKOFF, at least for trading cards), but most Mandarake stores in Japan are designed like really cramped little knockoff shops. But the Mandarake in Sapporo is the best that I've been to: it has space to let you breathe and walk easily. And it's still a huge store as well! It covers the same types of products as both "animate" and Bookoff, but all secondhand. And the Sapporo Mandarake's cosplay section is _huge_. I bought some books and model kits and homewares here - it's a very good spot to find older Pokemon merch no longer stocked anywhere else! 

### Suruga-ya

I didn't end up buying anything from this one, but it was another second-hand store in the same building as Mandarake, and took up a chunk of the basement floor as well as another floor in the building. Good variety of goods if your arms and backpack aren't already full of shopping by the time you're done in Mandarake! 

### Don Quijote and MEGA Don Quijote

Sapporo has at least two Donki stores that I'm aware of, and they are both like if a grocery store was also a department store covering all types of products anyone might need in their entire life. The regular Donki was 2 floors of goods, the MEGA Donki was 5 or 6 floors and also included additional trading card stores in its upper levels. These are fantastic stores to visit even if you're not grabbing nerd merch - they are a fantastic place to get "I found this food in Japan, try it!"-type items to share with people back home as well. 

### GEO

Great store for videogames, manga, TV shows, movies, electronics, and miscellaneous food and drink and so on. Kinda tucked away in one of the covered shopping streets in Sapporo, and I think they're a franchise chain as well, but this is another great spot to visit if you're questing for nerd stuff like I was. Just keep Google Translate handy - it's _all_ in Japanese in this store, no occasional English labels like in the other places I've listed. 


I bought a lot of merch across numerous visits to all of those stores. It's been awesome.

## White Illumination

It's like Vivid Sydney, but more-sensible and Christmas-coded and enhanced by snow.
