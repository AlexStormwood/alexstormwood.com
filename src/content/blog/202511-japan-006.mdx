Continuing on from [week three](/articles/202511-japan-005/), we continue exploring Sapporo for the final week of the holiday.



## Cinema!

So, "Predator: Badlands" came out in cinemas this month and I've been hanging out to see it. Wasn't sure which cinema to go to in Tokyo for this, so when I had a relatively-free day in Sapporo, I looked around for cinemas and booked a ticket.

The system for getting tickets online at Japanese movie theatres is a bit different to an Australian movie theatre... 

- The schedule comes out on a Thursday or Friday night a week or two before the session (I can't remember exactly, but it's not too far off Australian ways yet)
- The ability to book a ticket for a scheduled movie session only unlocks 48 hours or 2 days before the scheduled session. _This_ is very different to Australian cinema booking - if the schedule is up, you can book! Not so, for Japan.
- The movie schedule contains - at least for Sapporo Cinema Frontier - many more reruns or special one-off sessions than new releases. The variety is pretty great - this seemed better than what Event Cinemas typically runs here in Sydney. 
- After booking your chosen movie session, you get given a QR code to go and scan at a ticket redemption machine at the cinema. No digital tickets or phone app tickets - gotta get some paper to enter the cinema on the day of your session!

It was a bit to learn, but all doable in the end. 

The most exciting part though: the cinema had a merch store! You could buy movie memorabillia! I spent more on merch than I did on my movie ticket, and the movie ticket was $20AUD for a basic screening session. Australian cinemas need to sell merch!

There were numerous product stands for various animated and anime movies, and a few displays for other movies as well. Merch varies per movie, that makes sense. 

For "Predator: Badlands", they were selling tie-in or prequel comic books or graphic novel omnibuses. Epic stuff. 

And for almost all movies, they were selling movie "guides" or "programmes" - I'm not sure what to call them. The one I bought for "Predator: Badlands" contained behind-the-scenes interviews, movie photography, and was printed like the type of booklet you'd get from a orchestra or symphony event (niche, but the Doctor Who Symphonic Spectacular's booklet is the only similar thing I've seen). This was so cool - I bought one for the Predator movie for me, and one for a Gundam movie for my dad. And some anime merch for a friend!



## Suitengu Shrine and Mount Moiwa

This was a pretty place, but a disappointing shrine. I set my own expectations too high, after visiting other shrines...

I had planned to go up the cablecar and see the city from the observation deck at the top of Mount Moiwa, but walking around the Suitengu Shrine made me realise that the mountain is kinda... silly. It's really close to the city, yet a hassle to get to compared to other epic vantage points like the Sapporo Tower 38 or even the Sapporo TV Tower - both places that I'm planning to go up soon anyway. 

## Maruyama Park and Hokkaido Jingu

A great big temple! The walk to this temple _should_ be long, though you can drive right up to it. Essentially, this is the largest temple in Hokkaido - and has giant torii gates to match its size. The torii gates begin in the nearby suburbs, not the temple grounds, so you should walk a bit through the neighbourhood to reach the temple properly and respectfully!



## Maruyama Zoo 

Right next to Hokkaido Jingu, so you can visit both places in a single day. But... this was a sad place. I've grown up near Australia Zoo, I've seen how animals _should_ be cared for in a zoo environment. Japanese zoos just can't match that... 


## More Pokemon Center Merch! 

Pikachu building Pokemon-shaped snowmen! 


## Sapporo Tower 38

Revisiting a tourist destination from my last trip, but with more energy and a nicer camera this time.

## Shiroi Kobito - A Chocolate Theme Park 

I attempted to go to Otaru, but an earthquake and strict train track inspection protocols said no. So I went to a chocolate theme park instead! 

## Kamiteine Shrine

A quiet shrine with a great view.


## Catching Up With A Local Friend 

A friendship spawned from Pokemon Go?! 


## Winter Is The Flu Season, Everywhere

I made it so long without getting sick, but just as the trip reaches its end... I catch a cold. With every place I visited featuring sounds of coughing by this point in the trip, I kinda knew it was coming. Heck, as I sit here on the 8th of December - a full 4 days after landing back in Sydney - I'm still facing fevers, sore throats, headaches, and all that jazz. It's rough. Australian flu season never hit me this hard!

## Returning Home 

I won't do a separate post for "departure", like how I did one for just the arrival for this holiday - business class is business class! 

There was a brief worry of snow impacting my flights - ANA sent out a snow advisory warning on the morning of my departure day. My flight from Sapporo to Tokyo was scheduled for 7pm, and all flights after 6pm were expected to be delayed by snow. With just 90 minutes of a "layover" in Tokyo before my flight back to Sydney, that felt risky - but it was simple enough to change my Sapporo-Tokyo flight to an earlier one to avoid delays! 

This flight change meant I could spend more time in the ANA lounge at Haneda Airport as well - it's a nice lounge, very spacious, with great snacks and an udon noodle chef standing by as well. 

But most amazingly of all: 

- At Sapporo's New Chitose Airport, the Pokemon Store was before the baggage drop. So I could buy some airport-themed Pokemon merch and stuff it into my suitcases, keeping my carry-on backpack not-so-full! Each airport has its own specific plushies! 
- At Tokyo's Haneda Airport, a new Pokemon merch vending machine has been installed near gate 69 (nice) of terminal 2. So right before I walked on to my plane, I could get more airport-themed Pokemon merch! 

I got some airport-themed Pokemon merch in my January 2024 trip, but only one plushie per location - a pilot Pikachu wearing a badge of each airport. This time, I could get the flight attendant Pikachus from each airport. And even a new pilot Pikachu straddling an airplane!

Business class made the overnight flight much nicer, but it was still a bit of a struggle to sleep. I had some movies playing for the entire 9 hour flight, and slept through just one of them - it was a bit rough. I could at least put my feet up and recline comfortably though, it was great! 

And breakfast on the plane - eggs benedict here was phenomenal.


Overall, this was a fantastic holiday. I'm keen to go back to Japan, and also visit other countries during their snow seasons - and hopefully rent out an apartment or house the next time I do one of these longer holidays!
