## Holder vs Stormwood

So, most people know me as Alex Holder and that's normal.

In my work and life this year though, I've been exploring out of my little nook and meeting plenty of new people. 

Officially, I am Alex Holder - I was born under that name. The people I've been meeting at my day job have been meeting me under that name.

But people I've been meeting in gamedev industry networking and other online spaces know me through this name. Alex Stormwood.

Basically, a couple of years ago I started using a different name online:

I mean, the LinkedIn post kinda covers it all - other "Alex Holder"-named people out there exist, and many of us are building up our own online presences.

The straw that broke the camel's back was the political filmmaker. Back when I had a Twitter account, this guy made a documentary about Donald Trump.

Fans of Donald Trump did not like that man's movie.

Fans of Donald Trump are typically pretty dumb - I started getting harassment on Twitter from Donald Trump fans. Private messages, posts tagging me, and so on and so forth.

I'm happy to share names with people when it leads to each of us growing and improving our lives - but that guy, his movie, and the dumb Donald Trump fans... that's enough.

## Stormwood, Specifically

I just wanted something unique. Nothing more to it than that.

It feels a bit like a Dungeons & Dragons or general fantasy name, I know, but it works in my eyes!

## Making It Official

For the first year of using this Stormwood name, not much has happened. 

And then this year, in my day job, a bunch of stuff happened and now I'm interacting with plenty of new people.

Those of you who know me know I teach - so I meet new people plenty, but I can frame this name stuff to them as part of their "industry networking" classes. Professional names for networking, like how guild actors have professional names.

So throughout 2025, I've been meeting people that I'm _not_ teaching, and I've been getting uncomfortable with how mixed-up my name usage is becoming.

I need to make this Stormwood name official!

I'm going on a big holiday overseas shortly, and that's been the last major thing I've been waiting for before I legally change any part of my name. 

Australian passports are expensive, and changing my name requires me to send snail mail to the other side of the country. Not things I want to rush through before a holiday!

So, maybe sometime in 2026 this will become my proper legal name? Could be a fun thing to work towards next year!
