## Preface

I was writing a blog post about how the gamedev industry needs to catch up to the rest of the IT industry in the context of open-source tools and software, and it turned into a long monstrosity of an article. I wanna try and stay concise! Or at least, make a simple shareable little nugget of one of the key takeaways from that blog post.

The big takeaways from that almost-existed article were going to be two things: how the gamedev industry got so centralised around proprietary tools, and open-source alternatives to those proprietary tools. I'll finish that full article some other day, because even as I was writing that initial article, I was finding more and more crazy things to write about in the history of gamedev. It turns out that writing about the history, choices, and consequences of an industry trend that stretches back 50 years is a big topic! 

But here, we can at least start exploring open-source software, tools, technologies, etc, that can be used in a variety of industries, sectors, projects, businesses, and so on.

This page already assumes you know what open-source is, such as the open-source definition[^1]. The definition has an annotated version as well[^2], but I still find it a bit hard to digest some times. Open-source was made for a different sector of IT, which can be considered part of why gamedev has had such a hard time making major use of it as a philosophy - in my opinion. 

## Open-Source Tools, Technologies, Apps, and More 

This section will list and explain some of the more-notable (to me) open-source alternatives to proprietary tools, technologies, apps, and so on - across a variety of industries or sectors. For example, when providing a brief bit of information about Inkscape as an alternative to Adobe Illustrator for vector art, I'll be talking about my perceived trustworthiness and reliability of the open-source alternative, its licensing, and its feature parity to its proprietary competitor.

The key thing that really matters is the licensing though: open-source is pretty strict on which licenses actually count![^3]
