## Built Using Astro 

This website is built off of an Astro website template. 

You can make a website just like this, yourself, by installing a modern version of NodeJS and running this command to get the same template up and running locally:

`npm create astro@latest -- --template blog`

Read their [documentation website](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/) for more information, including guides and tutorials.

This template theme is based off of the lovely [Bear Blog](https://github.com/HermanMartinus/bearblog/).
